# 🔁 Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation on Digits Dataset

This project demonstrates how to apply **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** for model evaluation on the classic **Digits dataset** from `scikit-learn`. The goal is to ensure that each fold retains the same class distribution, leading to a more reliable and fair evaluation of classification models.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The `load_digits()` dataset contains:
- 1,797 images of handwritten digits (8x8 grayscale images)
- 10 output classes (digits 0–9)
- 64 pixel features per sample

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (`StratifiedKFold`)
- Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Accuracy measurement for each fold
- Comparison of model scores

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stratified-kfold-digits.git
   cd stratified-kfold-digits
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stratified-KFold-Digits-Dataset.ipynb
   ```

---

## 🔍 Project Flow

* Load the `digits` dataset
* Apply `StratifiedKFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`
* Loop over each fold:

  * Train a classifier
  * Evaluate accuracy
  * Collect fold-wise scores
* Analyze score consistency across folds

---

## ✅ Results

* Each fold maintains class balance
* More robust performance estimation compared to basic K-Fold
* Enables detection of overfitting and variance between folds
